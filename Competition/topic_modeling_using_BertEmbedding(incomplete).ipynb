it takes to dry  only takes a day to be able to grout with the pre mix  you can do as many rows as you like also    right o  i just didn t know if they would shift around with more rows stacked on them      you just make a level ledger   nd row   mark a center line on all walls then see where the last tile is going to be on sides and ceilings  you do the bottom row closest to the shower pan last after the ledger row dries    exactly  don t do the bottom row  st  for some reason makes getting everything to line up pretty difficult  and push everything flat on the tile with a level so it

the most useful advice but i would start at the beginning  p   very funny      i m serious    there are lots of  recommended  patterns when dealing with discworld series    but for me the answer is simple    just start with the first book and follow the order in which they were released    so why people recommend a different approach    there are many sub series within discworld    rincewind  witches  city watch  death and so on    some prefer to read it that way to focus on one set of characters    okay but you still think i should read everything in order    that is what i did    especially that there are characters that appear across several series    so that way you won t miss anything    oh now i get it    i ll just follow your advice    no problem    i really think  you re going to enjoy it ',\n"," '  where is my watch    i dont know   im sure you have it   what  why    are you out with mandy    so what    she likes watches   ok i will give it back when i come home   ha

you  are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent    this is one of the things we ve been discussing with my wife  what are the current trends  which option do you suggest    it depends on what you value more  it may sound obvious  but if you value stability more than flexibility  i would suggest you invest in buying a flat    we were looking for something bigger than what we own now  but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future    in this case i would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget  so you could save for later    thank you  this is a great advice    i will talk to my wife  but for now  i think we could focus on buying something similar size    how many rooms are you looking for    two bedrooms at least  joined kitchen and living room is fine as well    do you have any preferred neighbourhood    anywhere near the tube station within zone   is acceptable    thank you  what s your current budget    we were thinking about           would it be possible    i think so  would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated    it depends on how much we can sell our flat for    how much are you aiming for    at least           it s in a very good condition  good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago    could you please send me

    yeah  it s just different comparing to gas   gas  absolutely without a question  nothing else gives you the control    i m definitely more interested in a controllable consistent heat   with induction it s like on and off so you have to regulate temperature      induction  yes  gas  no cause it takes ages to boil water    you can always use an electric kettle you know    haha  not funny    it s easier to clean as well    i d go for induction cause it keeps the temp after you finish cooking so the food is still warm    induction         our induction was terrible  i think it s common    another vote for induction here     all chefs seem to say gas    i sell more induction hobs then gas  it s getting popular and i can see why    we got ours from the john lewis outlet so it was ex

budget here  but wouldn t mind saving some for more touristic stuff      cool  i find yori affordable and their prive value is really high in my opinion    same for the toff s  they mainly sell fish and fish and chips  so maybe check with your cousin if he likes it first    oh  i bet he d love to have an instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in london  hahaha    if i were you  i d focus on
